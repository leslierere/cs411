### Introduction

This is a project of CS411 Database Systems.

Our project, Class Seekers, is a locally hosted web server that allows students to create a profile, keep track of which classes they intend to take, and, for a certain class, obtain a list of all professors who have taught that class sorted by the average GPA of students who took that class with that professor. Class Seekers also recommends professors for desired classes based on RateMyProfessor ratings and also recommends other classes to take based on classes other students have taken.
