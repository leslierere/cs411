#### Write two extra SQL queries on a new wiki page titled "SQL Queries", linked in the "Documents" section under your team's main page. These queries should be more sophisticated than the basic query in CRUD; at minimum, they should involve at least two of the following:

- join of multiple relations, just join the GPA and TeacherRank, but a new table may need be created using the data in these two tables to achieve join
- set operations, 
- aggregation via GROUP BY. like calculate average GPA of a class by different professor
